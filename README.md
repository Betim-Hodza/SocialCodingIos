### Built With

> This is built in XCode on MacOS using Swift & SwiftUI
> In theory someone could write code w/ out xcode, 
> but its pretty hard to debug if your app works or not.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

> The project depends on Foundation import from apple, and SwiftSoup
> This is because the Events page uses webscraping to get its data.
> *[NOTE]* This is built on the base of XCODE 15 (my macbook is older)

### Installation

> The first thing you would need to do is clone this repo, 
> git clone https://github.com/Betim-Hodza/SocialCodingIos.git
> After cloning, just open the project in XCode and you can get started!

## Usage

> Currently the only way to demo it on a real iPhone, is to plug a
> iPhone into a mac, and build directly on your phone, which requires a lot of things.
> Or if you have a M series mac (or intel depending how new it is) you can run a 
> virtual iPhone and test it out that way.

## Support

> The best way to reach out to us is to put out something in the issues tab,
> and we will get to you as soon as we can.
